.Sh DESCRIPTION
rmtrash is a small utility that will move the file to macOS's Trash rather than obliterating the file (as rm does).
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It Fl f , -force
Ignore nonexistant files, and never prompt before removing.
.It Fl i
Prompt before every removal.
.It Fl I
Prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively. This option is less intrusive than -i, but still gives protection against most mistakes.
.It Fl -interactive Ar interactive
Prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i). If WHEN is not specified, then prompt always.
.It Fl x , -one-file-system
When removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from that of the corresponding command line argument 
.It Fl -preserve-root , -no-preserve-root
Do not remove "/" (the root directory), which is the default behavior.
.It Fl r , R , -recursive
Recursively remove directories and their contents.
.It Fl d , -dir
Remove empty directories. This option permits you to remove a directory without specifying -r/-R/--recursive, provided that the directory is empty. In other words, rm -d is equivalent to using rmdir.
.It Fl v , -verbose
Verbose mode; explain at all times what is being done.
.It Ar paths...
The files or directories to move to trash.
.It Fl -version
Show the version.
.It Fl -help
Show help information.
